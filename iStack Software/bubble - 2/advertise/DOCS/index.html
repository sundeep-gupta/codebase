 I can't use an html comment because my comments 
 need to included html comment tags. 
 That's why I'm using javascript comments.


 Documentation development notes - 8/19/02 :
 -------------------------------
 There are some things such as names of files that will 
 inevitably change in future versions. 
 In order to make updating future docs easier I've 
 inserted special commented tags around some things that 
 are likely to change.  In future versions of these docs 
 I can just do a search and replace on these tags and replace 
 old strings of text with new text.
 
 Example: 
 -------
 <!--<UPDATE>-->stdClassDbDump-1-03.sql<!--</UPDATE>--> 
 --------------------
 I know the name of this file will change in the future so I will be able 
 to easily find this and update when the time comes by doing a search 
 on my special <UPDATE> tag.
 I will only use one type of tag, named "UPDATE". 
 I don't need an elborate tagging system just something that will serve as
 a simple marker that I can use in a search.  
 I really don't plan on doing any automated updating, so I probably 
 don't need opening and closing tags, but just in case I change my mind in the future and choose to use a script to ferret out differences I thought it wouldn't hurt to go ahead and use opening and closing tags to encompass the 
 text in question.

<BR>
I strongly urge you to check in often for newer versions.  
<BR>
It's still a relatively new program and it's getting better all the time.
<BR>
I would appreciate it if you send me links to the site that is using D.E. Classifieds so I can include it in a "sites using D.E. Classifieds" section of 
my web site.
<BR>
I would also appreciate any suggestions you may have on what types of features 
you think should be included in future versions.
