Will CCNA help only for Network Administrators?|sundeep.techie|sundeep.techie@yahoo.co.in|1193727275|sundeep.techie|xx|0|196.15.16.20|Hi,<br />I read the article written by Razikh on CCNA, which says it adds value if you are looking for career in networking?<br /><br />If I'm looking for career in network programming at TCP/IP level (like algorithms for routers, protocol designing), how much value does CCNA add to it?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Sundeep||||

In this case CCNA doesn't play much of a role..<br /><br /> For Network programming I would suggest books like,[/font]<br /><br />[font=Courier]Effective TCP/IP Programming: 44 Tips to Improve Your Network Programs by Jon C. Snader<br /><br />Internetworking with TCP/IP, Vol. III: Client-Server Programming and Applications, Linux/Posix Sockets Version by Douglas E. Comer, David L. Stevens, and Michael Evangelista<br /><br />TCP/IP Networking: Architecture, Administration, and Programming by James Martin and Joseph Leben[/font]<br /><br />[font=serif]The best course for this would be doing M.Tech or M.S with Networking as specialization..[/font]<br /><br />--&gt;Raz&lt;--[/size]||||
