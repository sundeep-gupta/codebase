How to change colors in xterm|sundeep.techie|sundeep.techie@yahoo.co.in|1193726790|sundeep.techie|xx|0|196.15.16.20|Hi,<br /><br />I want to have context-sensitive colors in my Xterm window. <br />I googled for configuring the Xterm (not explored much), and I was able to configure it such that it changes the font, size, &nbsp;&amp; generic color.<br /><br />By generic color I mean, common color for whatever displayed.<br /><br />What I need is little different. Something like syntax highlighting shown in IDEs. So here in Xterm, it could be like when I type 'ls', it shows one color for directories, one for normal files, one for binaries.... etc.<br /><br />Please let me know if this is possible in xterm or not.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Sundeep||||
