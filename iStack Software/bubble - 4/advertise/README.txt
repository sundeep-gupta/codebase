  Summary:
    D.E. Classifieds is an easy way to set up a classified 
    ads web site.  It is designed in such a way that it is 
    extremely easy to change the look and feel of your web site.
    You can design your pages around the functionality of the application.
    Although this version does give you a lot of control over the look 
    and feel of the site, it still lacks an interface for advanced administration features.
    However all the administration can be done through an interface such 
    as phpMyAdmin.  If you know how to use phpMyAdmin or a similar application, 
    and are familiar with relational databases, it should be really easy 
    to administer categories and users, etc.


    Current features:
      - Unlimited tiers of categories
      - Unlimited number of categories 
      - Login/Logout
      - Registered users can add, delete, edit ads
      - uses html/php template file to manage look of site
      - search ads, including search by category
    
    Things you can do to customize it:
      - delete/add categories in the database
      - change html template file and the functions is uses

  
  Documentation:
    Documentation available in the "Docs" directory.
