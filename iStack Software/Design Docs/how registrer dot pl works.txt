Looking at Register page
------------------------
Lets get the flow:

-> YaBB.pl gets the parameter action as 'register'
-> Load Register.pl and call Register 
    ->read the $FORM values into variables
    -> open $langdir, which is the root directory where all language translations are stored
    -> Each directory represent a language .  use dir name as item in dropdown box
    -> validation-code method is run if $regcheck is enabled.
    -> I must be guest to register... else I get fatal error.
    -> Then prepare the html for the registration form. where we look for configuration info
	> $regcheck  for reason which I don't know
	> $RegAgree  for agreement
	> $emailpassword to either send password to email or not?
	> $allow_hide_email if hiding of email is allowed or not
	>
What happens after register button is clicked
----------------------------------------------
YaBB gets action as register2, which means we load Register.pl and get into register2 method
Here is the flow... as analyzed

-> fatal error if registration is disabled and we come till here... or if he is not a guest
-> redirect to home if user disagree on agreement
-> Make sure banned users, ips, mails, are not getting registered... if yes then fatal error
-> Validations include
    -> against existing users/emails
    -> against $regcheck variable
    -> against reserved words... banned user/ words
-> put default user info... IM, time date, display name... these are all configurable later
-> do something if $preregister ... donno what
-> if not preregister then comes ur actual flow.. of sending mail if you want password via mail
    or displaying a login form. The uid and password are stored hidden in the form so just login will
    make sure that u get registered completely.

->
