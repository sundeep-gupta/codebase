An aid in the study of the Ptolemaic (Macedonian-based Greek), Roman Imperial (Greco-Roman), and Byzantine rulers of Egypt based in Alexandria, this portal site is intended for all classicists and students of Hellenistic history. The House of Ptolemy web site concentrates on the Ptolemies and their world, from 331 - 30 BCE. However, since the histories of Greek rule and subsequent Roman rule overlap (and do so again later with Byzantine rule) this site includes Roman rule in Egypt, and the Byzantine rule that followed. During this almost 1000 years the dominant culture ['Hellenistic'] started as a Greek core with added native Egyptian and other foreign elements. These elements were both blended and kept distinctly separate, sometimes overlying the Greek core incompletely so that today scholars can focus on the Greek facets, the native Egyptian facets, the other outside influences, or all of these together when they discuss The House of Ptolemy and its legacies.The House of Ptolemy Web Site is an annotated information portal. Citations are presented generally with some comment. In a few cases minor web offerings or publications may be treated with (almost) the same importance as the most important and eloquent web offerings. However, I will try if at all possible to direct the viewer to the web sites or pages that present quality information. There are some descriptions of the linked materials (abstracts) to use but in some cases you might have to glean the content of a web publication just from its title or URL.XAIPE!

After many failed dynasties and deaths of great rulers, a time span of more than 400 years, power moved into the hands of priests and the empire declined. The dynasties became so weak, that Alexander the Great had no problem taking over Egypt. Although he did not spend much time in Egypt, his capital city of Alexandria, where he is believed to be buried, is to this day very successful. His empire was divided among his generals and this Greek dynasty ended with the reign of Cleopatra VII. She ruled jointly over Egypt with her son from their city of Alexandria in Lower Egypt, which became a world center of Greek culture. For over 300 years Greek-speaking pharaohs ruled Egypt, then Egypt became a province of Rome. A division of power resulted in the abandonment of Egypt. Many foreign countries came in and took over Egypt for short times. After many years of hard work and wars, Egypt finally became its own independent country with a President.

No other civilization in the time of the pharaohs could compete with Egypt's magnificent buildings, its wealth, or its long centuries of peace. To a large extent, this is because other civilizations did not have Egypt's main advantage -- its great river. For tens of thousands of years the focal point of Egyptian life has been the River Nile. Egypt is correctly said to be the gift of the Nile and Egypt's two most important areas are the Delta and the Nile Valley. The Nile Delta is the heartland of Egypt. The ancient Egyptians believed that the waters of the Nile came from a 'mysterious heaven of plenty'. All of Egypt depended on the Nile for water, food, and transportation. The need to maintain irrigation channels as well as the convenient transportation that the river provided were some of the reasons Egypt was the first country in the world to have a national government. The availability of this unlimited supply of water allowed the creation of a society which produced the wonders of ancient Egypt.
