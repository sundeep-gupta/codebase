<%@ page import ="java.io.*" %>
<%--
<jsp:useBean id="upload" class="net.kmmatrimony.TestUploadActionForm" scope="session">

<%
byte[] rgb=(byte[])session.getAttribute("byte");
if (rgb != null)
{
response.setContentType("image/gif");
OutputStream stream = response.getOutputStream();
stream.write(rgb);
}
else
{
response.setContentType("text");
response.getWriter().write("attribute byArr not found");
}
%>
<!--
The image data is now on the request object.
Forward the user to the showImage servlet.
That servlet will process and display the image data contained on the request object.
-->
<%--
Image is<p>
<jsp:forward page="/showimage" />
