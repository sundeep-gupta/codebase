1) create a population of size 100 x 4 X 2 with random double values in the range 0 and 1
                    Here 100 is the size of the population
                          4  is the dimension size
                          2  is the number of clusters.

2) lets say the firt chromosome is i which is pointing to 0th chromosome in the population.

3) randomly select 3 chrmosomes from the remaining i-1 chromosomes.

4) name them as a , b and c   (i != a != b != c)

           Here a, b and c have the same number of clusters as 'i'   i.e 2

5) do some math operation on the 3 chromosomes. 
          say a + f(b-c)      where f=0..75

6) lets say the resultant chromosome as result

     Here the result also has 2 clusters i.e. same as the size of 'i'.

7) In total 2 clusters there are totally 8 points. 

7) For each value of j (i.e. for totally 8 points generate 8 times) now randomly generate a number between 0 and 1 and compare it with the crossover value i.e. 0.8

8) if the randomly generated number is less than 0.8 then the child's chromosome individual is selected else the ith chromosomes individual is selected.

9) Finally a new chromosome is created from the ith chromosome and the result chromosome and say it as temp chromosome.

10) Now we have ith chromosome and the temp chromosome with 2 clusters in each say c1 and c2 .
         (here temp chromosome is the one after crossover)

11) HERE comes the FITNESS function into picture.

12) There are totally 150 data points in the text file which is 4 in dimension i.e (x1, x2, x3, x4)

13) Pick a point randomly from the text file and find the distance between that point to the cluster c1 and cluster c2.
          (Here the distance is calculated same as in the co-oridnate geometry)

                sqrt[ (x1-x2) ^ 2 + (y1 - y2) ^ 2 ]

14) The point is assigned to that cluster from which it has minimum distance.

15) That point is stored in an array. (lets for e.g if point is close to c1 then the point is stored in c1 array or else
                         it is stored in c2 array)


16) In the same fashion allocate all the remaining 149 data points to both the clusters c1 and c2.

17) At the end we have 2 clusters c1 and c2 with 

        c1 having datapoints as 1, 4, 11, 23..............

        c2 having datapoints as 2, 3, 7 , 9,..............

18) Determine centroid of c1 and centroid of c2.

  centroid is calculated as (x1 + x2 + x3.....)/ number of points.
                                    (y1 + y2 + y3.....)/ number of points.
                                    (z1 + z2 + z3.....)/ number of points.
                                    (w1 + w2 + w3.....)/ number of points.
 
             lets say the centroid is (x, y, z, w)
       
19) Determine cluster scatter i.e. distance between centroid c1 and its points
 
                ( same as co-ordinate geometry distance calculation)
        also repeat cluster scatter for c2.


19) Now determine inter cluster distance i.e distance between c1 and c2 centroids.
               
20) Now we have c1 scatter and c2 scatter and distance between them.

             (c1 scatter + c2 scatter)   / distance between c1 and c2.

21) Divide the result by number of clusters which is the FITNESS.

22) Repeat the same for other chromosome also and calculate the fitness.

23) compare the two fitness values.Whichever value has less fitness take that chromosome and copy into a new population and ignore the other chromosome.

24) now increment the value of i and repeat steps 3 thru 22 till the new population reaches a size of 100 x 4 X 2.

25) find the minimum fitness of the total population and compare that with the stopping condition.

26) if that is reached jus stop and print the number of generations to reach the required result.
