saivamsy: no da 
saivamsy: I mean 
sundeep_techie: Ok u mean the way code looks right
sundeep_techie: Ok then send me

sundeep_techie: tell me when do u need it?

saivamsy: we have other commands to compile 
saivamsy: u can include those files then 
saivamsy: i mean those commands 
sundeep_techie: Just send it across & give me a brief about what this code is for?
saivamsy: code is about clustering da 
saivamsy: its about chromosomes 
saivamsy: its a 3 dimension 
sundeep_techie: excellent. Now i'm more excited tosee the code
saivamsy: each chromosome is of a 3 dimensioon 
saivamsy: and we caliculate the fitness of each chromosome 
saivamsy: and the best chromosome is taken 
saivamsy: thats the basic idea 
saivamsy: of the program 
saivamsy: what I have implemented 
saivamsy: I have taken a function called IRIS function 
saivamsy: which has 150 data sets 
saivamsy: where each data set 
saivamsy: is of 4 points 
saivamsy: and I take a data set randomly 
saivamsy: and compare it with remaining datasets 
saivamsy: and make 3 clusters out of the 4 data sets 
saivamsy: hey sundeep 
saivamsy: r u there
