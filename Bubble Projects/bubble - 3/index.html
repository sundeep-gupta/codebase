      <div align="justify">How many times were you in need of your colleague or friend next cubical to solve the bug in your code ? Well!!! I always need them atleast once a day.
      And many need me!!!

        <p>8 out of 10 questions answered by me required my very basic knowledge. Same might apply to the answer I recieve from others. Being an software geek!! I thought of applying the pareto
        principle to this problem.</p>
        <p>I grouped 2 of my friends and when we analyzed the time spent solving the queries and getting answers to queries, the result was interesting.
        we saw that about 20% of our work-time is used by these trivia questions. This means more than an hour!! </p>
        <p>We formed this website as an answer to save the time. Remember!!! Time once gone won't come back. This website is an intiative by the Bubble team
        towards sharing the day-to-day experiences of geeks like you and me. </p>
        <p> Those who are looking for answer can post us the question through forums and get the query answered
        </p>
        <p>You have information which you want to share, send it to us and it will be posted in articles section with your name</p>
        <p>News section is all about the latest market knowledge in Computer industry.</p>
