The .conf file are sample configuration files. They all use images in
the /abicons/ web path, to make them show properly, you must copy
the abicons/ directory to your web site.

To add different pre configured settings to tthe system, just copy
the .forum_cfg file to master_cfg_dir and name it with .conf extension.
All configuration files should be uploaded as BINARY files, NOT ascii files.
