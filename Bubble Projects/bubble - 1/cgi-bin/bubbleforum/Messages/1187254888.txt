Technically speaking, your phone has the capability and required software for playing music on ur stereo bluetooth headset. However, they are not enabled in ur phone's OS. This is due to Microsoft's Marketing issue, &quot;All that Proprietary Software crap&quot;.<br />But, u needn't worry. There is a work around. I had mentioned it in the following article.<br />http://www.bubble.co.in/display_article.php?articleid=a2dp.xml<br />Lemme know ur feedback. &nbsp;:)<br />- Aby||||
