                Focus of this article is to explain procedure to bypass
                password for SSH connection.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>SSH</b> stands for <b>S</b>ecure <b>SH</b>ell.
                It was developed in order to enable secure remote administration
                of <b>Linux</b>/<b>UNIX </b>machine. SSH is widely used to
                connect to Linux machine form a Windows machine. The most
                popular SSH client utility on Windows is <b>PuTTY</b>. 
                This can be downloaded from the following location:

            <p>
                Authentication through SSH happens by RSA or DSA key pair
                exchange.

                <p>
                    As we know that the authentication in case of SSH happens by key
                    pair exchange, we'll start by generating <b>Private</b> 
                    &amp;<b>Public</b> key pair.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Private Key will remain with the <b>host</b> (local host from
                    which we want to connect) &amp; Public key will be placed in <b>
                    remote host</b> (to which we want to connect without password)
                </p>
                <p>
                    To generate keys, issue following command:
                </p>
                <section>
                <p>
                    <code>ssh-keygen -t rsa</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    For <b>password/paraphrase prompts</b>, just hit <b>ENTER </b>
                </p>
                </section>
                <p>
                    This generates public &amp; private RSA keys in <b>.ssh</b>
                    directory of user's <b>home directory</b> as <b>id_rsa</b>
                    &amp; <b>id_rsa.pub</b>
                </p>
                <p>For example,</p>
                <section>
                    <p>
                        For <b>root</b> user, these keys will be generated <b>in
                        /root/.ssh/</b> directory
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For <b>daffy</b> user, these keys will be generated in
                        <b>/home/daffy/.ssh/</b> directory
                    </p>
                </section>
                <p>
                    Once generation is done, place <b>id_rsa.pub</b> file in remote
                    <b>.ssh</b> directory located under <b>user's</b>
                    <b>home</b> directory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, for <b>root</b> user,
                </p>
                <section>
                    <p>
                        Copy <b>id_rsa.pub</b> to remote host's <b>/root/.ssh/</b> 
                        directory. This can be done as following,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From .ssh directory (/root/.ssh)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <code>
                            #scp id_rsa.pub remotehost_machine:/root/.ssh
                        </code>
                    </p><p>
                        For <b>daffy</b>,
                    </p><p>
                        Copy <b>id_rsa.pub</b> to remote user <b>daffy's</b> .ssh 
                        directory, i.e., <b>/home/daffy/.ssh/</b> directory. as
                        following,
                    </p><p>
                        From .ssh directory, (/home/daffy/.ssh)
                    </p><p>
                        <code>#scp id_rsa.pub remotehost_machine:/home/daffy/.ssh</code>
                    </p>
	          </section>
             </section>
            <p>
                After id_rsa.pub is copied to remote machine, login to the
                remote machine and copy content of <b>id_rsa.pub</b> file to <b>
                authorized_keys</b> file in <b>.ssh</b> directory. This can be
                done as following,
            </p><p>
                <code>#cat id_rsa.pub &gt;&gt;authorized_keys</code>
            </p><p>
                <b>Create authorized_keys file if it doesn't exist.</b>
            </p><p>
                Create .ssh directory if doesn't exist in case of services
                which are set with <i>nologin</i> shell (Ex: apache user for
                apache webserver)
            </p><p>
                Now you are ready to check your connectivity.
            </p><p>
                Try accessing remote host through <b>ssh</b>. <b>You will be
                able to access without a password</b>.
            </p><p>
                <b>Bypassing password for SSH connection helps a lot in
                developing automation scripts for Linux machine monitoring, data 
                collection &amp; test scripts execution.</b>
